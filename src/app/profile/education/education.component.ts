Students study and implement classical data structures such as list, stack, queue, tree, priority queue, hash table, graph, set, and dictionary. Formal efficiency analysis is used to evaluate the complexity of algorithms for these data structures. Students gain proficiency in writing recursive methods. Students design and implement software individually, in small groups, and in a challenging multi-week team project.several basic topics regarding simple cyber security techniques.", "assets/images/intro_green.jpg", "B", "https://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/course-catalog/current/programs/Computer%20Science/csse-230.html"),

Topics include: error metrics, accuracy vs interpretability trade-off, feature selection, feature engineering, bias-variance trade-off, under-fitting vs. overfitting, regularization, cross-validation, the bootstrap method, the curse of dimensionality and dimensionality reduction using the singular value decomposition. Both parametric and nonparametric methods are covered including: k-nearest neighbors, linear and logistic regression, decision trees and random forests, and support vector machines.", "assets/images/intro_green.jpg", "B+", "https://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/course-catalog/current/programs/Mathematics/ma-415.html"),

Optimization models studied include linear programs, integer programs, and various network models. The course will emphasize modeling, algorithm design, and the associated mathematical theory, e.g. polyhedral, duality, convex analysis.
